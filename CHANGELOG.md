# Changelog

## [v0.0.3] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- The manifest's `kind` is now `core`, not `emulator`. A core that emulates
  nothing -- Doom -- showed that the old word named a subset rather than the
  set, so the spec took the general term and the SDK and the spec now agree.
  The previous release publishes the old value and no longer validates.

## [v0.0.2] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- Published under the [GWRG distribution
  spec](https://github.com/slash-proc/gwrg-dist-spec): a `manifest.json`
  describing this core and the systems it provides, an offline bundle, and a
  GitHub Pages mirror of `dist/` that a web installer can read without a human
  in the loop.
- `symbols[]` publishes the linked ELF so a crash address from a device can be
  resolved back to a function. It is named by the manifest and mirrored, but is
  not part of the install set and never reaches the card.
- `gwrg.json`, the hand-written half of the manifest: the short console name,
  whether compressed ROMs work, and any BIOS this core needs. Everything else —
  the systems, their folders, extensions and browse mode, the firmware ABI,
  sizes and hashes — is derived from the packed binary at release time.
- The PC Engine CD system declares the System Card 3 BIOS it cannot run
  without, with a hash, and states that a `.cue` travels with its `.bin`
  tracks so an installer cannot copy half a game and report success.
- `biosDir` says the System Card lives in `/bios/pce/`, not `/bios/pcecd/`.
  The ROM folder and the BIOS folder are separate keys that happen to match
  for most systems and do not here, so nothing could have derived it.

### Changed

- `scripts/make_manifest.py`, `build_dist.py`, `make_bundle.py` and
  `stage_release.py` are now the shared copies, byte-identical across every
  project. A script that has to be edited on the way in is a script that drifts.
